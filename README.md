# sia-antfarm

sia-antfarm is a collection of utilities for performing complex, end-to-end
tests of the [Sia](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia) platform.  These test
are long-running and complex, and offer superior insight into high-level
network behaviour than Sia's existing automated testing suite.

# Prerequisites

You must have `siad` installed.  If it's outside of your path, provide its location using the `-siad` flag.  For all flags, see `sia-antfarm -h`.
