# sia-antfarm

sia-antfarm is a collection of utilities for performing complex, end-to-end
tests of the [Sia](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia) platform.  These test
are long-running and complex, and offer superior insight into high-level
network behaviour than Sia's existing automated testing suite.
